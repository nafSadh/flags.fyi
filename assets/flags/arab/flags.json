      "The Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan was a short-lived country that was formed in 1958 ",
      "from the union of Iraq and Jordan. Although the name implies a federal structure, it was ",
      "_de facto_ a confederation.\n  ",
      "The Federation was formed on 14 February 1958, when King Faisal II of Iraq and his cousin, ",
      "King Hussein of Jordan, sought to unite their two Hashemite kingdoms, as a response to the ",
      "formation of the United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria. The union lasted only six ",
      "months, being officially dissolved on 2 August 1958, after Faisal was deposed by a ",
      "military coup on 14 July."
