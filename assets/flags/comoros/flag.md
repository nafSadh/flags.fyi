## Design

The national flag of the **Union of the Comoros**
(officially French: Union des Comores, Comorian: Udzima wa Komori,
Arabic: الاتّحاد القمريّ‎, al-Ittiḥād al-Qamarī)
consists of:

- a white crescent with four white five-pointed stars inside of a green triangle
- the flag has four stripes, representing four islands of the nation:
  - Yellow is for Mohéli
  - White is for Mayotte (claimed by Comoros but administered by France)
  - Red is for Anjouan
  - Blue is for Grande Comore.

The four stars on the flag also symbolize the four islands of the Comoros.  
The star and crescent symbol stands for their main religion, Islam.

The stars point usually point up as reflected in the model supplied when the flag
was adopted, but legal documents concerning the flag do not specify the flags
orientation and there are variants in which the stars point outwards and not up.

## Trivia

- The name **Comoros** derives from derives from the Arabic word قمر /qamar/
  which means "moon", hence the crescent.
