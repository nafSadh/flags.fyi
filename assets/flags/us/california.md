## Description

The modern state flag of California is white with a wide red strip along the
bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing
left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The
size of the bear is 2/3 the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1.
The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1.<sup>[†](#fn1)</sup>
The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836.

The 1953 legislation defined the exact shades of the California flag with a
total of five colors (including the white field):

- Seal is used for the dark shading of the bear, the 12 darker tufts in the
  plot of grass, the border of the plot and the lettering "CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC".
- Maple Sugar is the base color for the bear.
- Old Glory Red is used for the star, the bear's tongue and the red stripe at
  the bottom of the flag.
- Irish Green is used for the grass plot.
- The bear's claws are also accented with white. The left front and rear paws
  have four white claws while the right rear claw displays three. The front
  right paw does not contain highlighting.

## Trivia

- Flag of California is one of only four US state flags that does not contain
  the color blue (the other three being Alabama, Maryland, and New Mexico).
