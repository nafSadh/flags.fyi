## Design

The **flag of Egypt** (علم مصر [ˈʕælæm mɑsˤɾ]) is a tricolor consisting of the
three equal horizontal red, white, and black bands of the Egyptian revolutionary
flag. The flag bears Egypt's national emblem, the Egyptian eagle of Saladin
centered in the white band.

## Trivia

- Egypt's Revolutionary and Liberation flag was then an inspiration to several
  Arab countries and was adopted by many Arab states. The same tricolor is used
  by Iraq, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen (and formerly Libya)
