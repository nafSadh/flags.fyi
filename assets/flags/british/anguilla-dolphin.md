The **Dolphin Flag** of Anguilla was adopted on September 29, 1967, after the
colony (then part of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla) unilaterally declared
independence from the United Kingdom as the Republic of Anguilla. It depicted
three orange dolphins in a circle on a white background with a turquoise stripe
at the bottom. It was used until March 19, 1969, when British rule was restored.

- The white background on the flag represents peace.
- The turquoise stripe represents the Caribbean Sea.
- The three dolphins represent endurance, unity, and strength,  
  and their circular arrangement represents community.

Theis flag replaced the earlier "Mermaid Flag" of Anguilla.

Although no longer official, the Dolphin Flag is still flown today.
