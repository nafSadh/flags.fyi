## Origins and Symbolism

The design is related to the flags of France, Spain, Catalonia and Foix, the
lands historically linked with the small country. The coat of arms of Andorra in
the center of the flag contains historical symbolism to Bishop of Urgell, Count
of Foix, Catalonia, and the Viscounty of BÃ©arn. The inclusion of the coat of
arms makes it one of 28 national flags to contain overtly Christian symbolism.
A flag of three bars is similar to that of the French Tricolor, while the
pattern of a wider middle stripe can be noted on the Spanish flag.
The motto in the coat of arms in the middle stripe _Virtus Unita Fortior_ means
"Virtue United is Stronger". The blue and red of the Andorran flag are also
found on the French flag, with red and yellow also being the colors of the
Catalan flag (as the old royal symbol of the Crown of Aragon) and the arms of
the old County of Foix (currently part of France).
