## Description

The national flag of Algeria (Arabic: علم الجزائر‎, romanized: ʿalam al-jazāʾir,
Berber languages: ⴰⵛⴻⵏⵢⴰⵍ ⵏ ⴷⵣⴰⵢⴻⵔ, romanized: Acenyal n Dzayer ) consists of two
equal vertical bars, green and white, charged in the center with a red star and
crescent, a symbol of Islam as the nation's prominent faith. The flag was
adopted on 3 July 1962. A similar version was used by the Algerian government in
exile from 1958–1962.
