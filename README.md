> **Flags** _for your info_, by Flagstaff

## About

**Flags.fyi** _by "Flagstaff"_ is a web compendium of flag info. It revolves
around [`flags.json`](https://flags.fyi/flags.json) that contains stuff (images,
description etc.) of [vexillologic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology)
interest. https://flags.fyi is the canonical web app that is aimed to present
these data in an user friendly manner.

### Flagstaff

Flags.fyi is a project by "Flagstaff", an unincorporated entity, led by
[nafSadh](https://nafSadh.com).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Definitions

- **Canonical path** is supposed to remain unchanged wrt time. For example,
  `https://flags.fyi/` should always refer to this website. In the same way,
  `https://flags.fyi/flags.json` is the canonical path for the JSON file holding
  flag data.
- In most cases we will be using **canonical rpath** (or simply "rpath"). A
  **rpath** is canonical path relative to site root; e.g., `flags.json` is rpath
  for aforementioned JSON. Site root can be referred to as `/`, but for other
  rpath, there should not be any leading slash.

## Directory Structure

Flagstaff/flags.fyi is built as a NuxtJS app and has following directory
structue:

- ~/**assets**
  - ~/assets/**export**: Contents from this directory is copied to generated
    site root. All content related to one country is usually placed in the same
    sub-directory. Files in this sub-directory should match rpath. This dir is
    virtually same as `~/static`.
  - ~/assets/**logo**: Directory for logo files.
  - ~/assets/**scss**: SCSS files.
- ~/**components**: Files for Vue.js Components. _Not supercharged by NuxtJS._
- ~/**layouts**: Vue files for
  [NuxtJS layouts](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/views#layouts).
- ~/**middleware**: {not used}
  [NuxtJS middleware](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware).
- ~/**pages** : This directory contains Application Views and Routes. NuxtJS
  reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the
  [router](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing) of the app.
- ~/**plugins**: Javascript [plugins](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins) that
  needs to run before mounting the root Vue.js application.
- ~/**static**: [Static files]](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static). Each
  file inside this directory is mapped to `/`. `CNAME` and `flags.json` resides
  here.
- ~/**store**: {not used} For [Vuex Store](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store).

## URL Structure

- Root url is `https://flags.fyi/`.
- `index/` shall be an index of all flags currently hosted.
- Site is mostly flatly structured so that URLs can be as short as semantically
  plausible.
- Page about a flag is at `flag-id` - this is always direct child of root.
  Location of a flag image is directly related to flag-id. Flag location is one
  hop away from root. Flag id can be grouped around top level entities (i.e.,
  country, internation organizatio, civilization etc.). The flag image directly
  related to top level entity is at `${entity}/flag.svg` and other flags are at
  `${entity}/{flag-name}.ext`; flag-id for the later is of the format
  `entity-flag-name`.  
  For example, national flag of Bangladesh is at `bangladesh/flag.svg` and the
  flag-id for it is `bangladesh`. The Naval Ensign for Bangladesh Navy is at
  `bangladesh/navy.svg` and the flag-id is `bangladesh-navy`. The historic flag
  used by the country in 1971 is at `bangladesh/1971.svg` and the flag-id for it
  is `bangladesh-1971`.
