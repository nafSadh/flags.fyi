## Design

The national flag of Antigua and Barbuda is a red field with an inverted isosceles
triangle based on the top edge of the field pointed toward the bottom edge of the
field bearing the horizontal tricolour of black, light blue (half width) and white
with the rising sun (yellow half sun with nine rays) centred on top of the black band.

## Symbolism

- the rising sun symbolises the dawning of a new era
- the color black is for the African ancestry of the people
- the color blue is for hope
- the color red is for energy or life of the people
- the successive colouring of yellow, blue, and white (from the sun down) also
  stands for the sun, sea, and sand
- the blue also represents the Caribbean Sea
- the V-shape is the symbol of victory

## History

The flag was adopted on 27 February 1967 to mark the achievement of self-government.
A competition to design the flag was held in which more than 600 local people entered.
The winning design was put forth by nationally well-known artist and sculptor
Sir Reginald Samuel.
